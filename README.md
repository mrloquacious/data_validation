# Data Validation

## About
This is a class project for CS 410 Data Engineering, Winter 2021.

We used Oregon Highway 26 crash data from 2019 and documentation on the specifications of the data fields for this project. The goal was to gain a better understanding of what the validation process might look like in a real world situation. Without much background, we needed to figure out the structure of the data, perform some analysis, and determine how to appropriately validate the columns. The project was instructive on how we might approach validation of our term project data and remains incomplete as I've turned my focus to the term project.
